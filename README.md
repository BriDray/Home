# User Story

AS A user
I WANT to organize my personal belongings
SO THAT I can be prepared to make my insurance claim in case of a break, fire, or natural disaster

# Elevator Pitch
Home is an application to help the user better track their personal belongings. Lets face it. Life happens, and it's important to keep track of our items that are expensive and help make life easier. If you have ever had to deal with making a claim via insurance due to a break in, house fire, natural disaster, etc. then you know they require some basic information in order for them to approve the claim. Home is meant to help the user be prepared and hold all that information in one place. keeping the user prepared, and not having to deal with the stress of making a list at such an emotional time. 

# Description
Home is an app that is meant to help the user keep their personal belonging information in one place; in case of the need for an insurance claim.

# Motivation for Development
"After personal experience, Having to make a major claim with my insurance due to a Break in. I learned what the insurance companies required in order for them to approve a claim. I remember being stressed about missing something major. it would have been really nice to have an app that could have logged my items beforehand. Hopefully this will help someone else be prepared for the unthinkable." -Bri Dray
